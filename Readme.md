# My second capstone

### Gaming Development Startup Analysis


An analysis using the VGChartz.com dataset (source from Kaggle) to gain valuable insights on gaming trends, popular platforms, and top publishers over the past five years, from 2018 to 2022. This information can inform strategic decisions on game development, marketing, and business partnerships, ultimately helping startup developers to succeed in the competitive gaming industry. The analysis will focus on sales figures, platforms, and publishers. Analysis was done in the pgAdmin platform (PostgreSQL) and results were exported into Microsoft Excel to create a Dashboard for visualisation.

### What are the changes
- Raw data in .csv format, download from Kaggle
- Using SQLite, convert .csv into .sql and import into pgAdmin platform for Data Cleaning.

- Game titles with the highest sales: **Red Dead Redemption 2**, **Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII**, **FIFA 19**

Recommendations for the upcoming development are as follows
- The ‘actions’ styles of games are more popular.
- Seek cooperation with Nintendo as the game’s main publisher.
- Focus on running the new game on PS (PlayStation) as the main platform.
- Primary target markets are North America and the PAL region.




### Future Improvement (ver. 2.0)
- To include Y2021 and Y2020 dataset.
- To add Wind charts into the Dashboard for analyse.
